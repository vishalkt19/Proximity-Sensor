# Proximity-Sensor
This is a mini project on Proximity Sensor using LM 358 Sensor

The project is designed for non-contact door-bell system using LM-358 sensor.

Amidst of the pandemic time, health concerns are a part of major discussion and hence this project is developed based on these concerns. 

This project proposes a system of Touchless-door bell system which brings the attention of the Owner of the Visitor.  

This is achieved with help of a LM-358 Comparator. 

The IR-Emitter emits infrared energy and when an obstacle is brought in front of it, the emitted ray gets reflected back and is caught by the IR-Photodiode (Receiver). 

When IR radiation is incident on the IR photo diode, current is generated (which is directly proportional to the closeness of the obstacle to the sensor). 

This current is passed on to the LM358 IC. If the obstacle is close enough to the sensor, the current generated is large enough to generate the BUZZ-sound. 

Switch is used to temporarily turn of the device when not in use to save the battery.
